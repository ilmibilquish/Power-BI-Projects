## 1. High-Level KPIs (Top Section)
At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators (KPIs) provide a snapshot of tourism metrics:

- Total Tourist Visits reflects overall footfall across all regions and months.
- Total Revenue shows the cumulative financial gain generated from tourist activities.
- Average Satisfaction Rating reveals the general sentiment of tourists, measured through customer feedback scores.

These figures establish the baseline for performance evaluation and contextualize all other visual elements.

## 2. Trend Over Time: Tourist Visits by Month (Line Chart)
The line chart illustrating Monthly Tourist Visits across all regions provides critical insight into seasonal patterns. The visual clearly shows that tourism is concentrated within a six-month period, indicating a strong seasonality in tourist behavior. There is a visible dip in activity outside this window, confirming that off-peak months see minimal to no visits.

This information is crucial for operational planning, workforce allocation, and seasonal marketing.

## 3. Total Tourist visits and Revenue by Region (Bar Chart)
The bar chart showcasing Total Tourist visit and Revenue by Region which highlights the financial contribution of each area. The South, West, and North regions emerge as top performers, generating the highest revenue. In contrast, Central and East regions lag behind, indicating potential for strategic interventions or marketing focus.

This visualization supports decisions related to resource allocation, infrastructure investments, and promotional activities.

## 4. Satisfaction Ratings by Region (Donut Chart)
The satisfaction ratings across regions show that the South region leads in customer satisfaction, followed by the West and North. However, when comparing this chart to the revenue visual, we see that higher satisfaction does not directly correlate with higher revenue, a key insight that shifts attention toward tourist volume as the primary performance driver rather than service quality alone.

This finding could guide expectations around service investment ROI.

## 5. Monthly Activity by Region (Line Chart ‚Äì Small Multiples or Combo)
The regional breakdown of monthly tourist activity reveals when each region receives its highest footfall:

- Central, East, and North see peak tourism in the first half of the year.
- South and West dominate the second half.

This segmentation reinforces the need for region-specific and time-sensitive strategies, such as marketing bursts, event planning, or maintenance scheduling.

## 6. Key Highlights & Recommendations (Text Panel)
On the right side of the dashboard, a summary of key findings and strategic recommendations is provided:

- Tourist volume is the main driver of revenue.
- Satisfaction has limited influence on financial performance.
- Tourism is highly seasonal, with each region having distinct peak periods.
- Based on these findings, the recommendations suggest:
- Launching seasonal promotions to maximise peak performance.
